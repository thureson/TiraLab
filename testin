Besides explaining JavaScript, I also will introduce the basic principles
of programming. Programming, it turns out, is hard. The fundamental
rules are typically simple and clear. But programs built on top of these
rules tend to become complex enough to introduce their own rules and
complexity. You’re building your own maze, in a way, and you might
just get lost in it.
There will be times when reading this book feels terribly frustrating.
If you are new to programming, there will be a lot of new material to
digest. Much of this material will then be combined in ways that require
you to make additional connections.
It is up to you to make the necessary effort. When you are struggling
to follow the book, do not jump to any conclusions about your own
capabilities. You are fine—you just need to keep at it. Take a break,
reread some material, and always make sure you read and understand the
example programs and exercises. Learning is hard work, but everything
you learn is yours and will make subsequent learning easier.

Besides explaining JavaScript, I also will introduce the basic principles
of programming. Programming, it turns out, is hard. The fundamental
rules are typically simple and clear. But programs built on top of these
rules tend to become complex enough to introduce their own rules and
complexity. You’re building your own maze, in a way, and you might
just get lost in it.
There will be times when reading this book feels terribly frustrating.
If you are new to programming, there will be a lot of new material to
digest. Much of this material will then be combined in ways that require
you to make additional connections.
It is up to you to make the necessary effort. When you are struggling
to follow the book, do not jump to any conclusions about your own
capabilities. You are fine—you just need to keep at it. Take a break,
reread some material, and always make sure you read and understand the
example programs and exercises. Learning is hard work, but everything
you learn is yours and will make subsequent learning easier.

A program is many things. It is a piece of text typed by a programmer,
it is the directing force that makes the computer do what it does, it is
